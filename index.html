                        <p>If you're doing your inventory by hand or using a system that isn't simple you're wasting money in more ways than you'd imagine. It takes longer, is error-prone, and can lead to spoilage that's not only costly but limits how many people you can help.</p>

Tallying your food by hand, keeping written records, and trying to keep track of when to reorder all takes time that could be better spent with the people that depend on your service.</p>
